## Chicken Chili Recipe

#### By Laynie March 14, 2022

### On snow days, I love having chili for dinner. My favorite chili recipe is from [Campbell's](https://www.campbells.com/swanson/recipes/black-bean-corn-and-turkey-chili/) Black Bean, Corn, and Turkey Chili. Whenever I can’t find grounded Turkey, I just use chicken breasts and I taylor it to my liking.

## Ingredients for Chili:

### 1 teaspoon of cooking olive oil

### 1 lb of chicken breasts

### 2 tablespoons of chili powder

### 1 teaspoon of cumin (grounded)

### 1 teaspoon of oregano leaves

### ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

### ¼ teaspoon garlic powder (you can also use 1 or 2 cloves of garlic, minced)

### 2 teaspoons of white sugar

### 1 can of black beans

### 1 can of whole kernel corn

### 3 cans of tomato sauce

### 1 large white or red onion (chopped)

## Ingredients for White Rice:

### 1 teaspoon of cooking olive oil

### 2 ½ cups of white rice

### 2 ½ cups of water

## --------

## Chicken Chili:

### Heat a 5-quart cast iron pot on medium-low heat. Wait a few seconds and then add chicken breasts, and while in the pot add chili powder, cumin, oregano leaves, black pepper, and garlic powder. Cook for 30 minutes.

### After 30 minutes, remove chicken and shred to pieces using a fork and knife (depending on how big you would like the pieces). While chicken is being shredded, add onions, cook for 3 minutes, and then add tomato sauce and let it get to a boil. You can let it boil for 5 minutes.

### Add shredded chicken back to the pot. Rinse out black beans and corn and add to the pot. Cook for 30-40 minutes on low.

## White Rice:

### Heat a 3-quart stainless steel pot and then add cooking olive oil. Add 2 ½ cups of water and let it get to a boil. While boiling, rinse out rice (helps clean from any rocks or impurities, but not for a long time because will deplete all added nutrients). And then let the water dry up until you see the spoon could stand on its own in the pot. Then cover for twenty minutes on low. After 20 minutes, check rice and fluff with a spoon and let it sit for another ten minutes. Serve with chili and nachos and a little salad on the side!
