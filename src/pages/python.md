## Musings on Python

### Python first appeared 31 years ago, but it wasn’t until 2020 that I finally decided to learn it and master it. Took me a while to understand it and then once I thought I knew it well, ha, ha ha. It was just the beginning.

### I do want to show others what I’ve learned and in the following, you will find my short versions of tutorials on Python 3. I will go over the Basics and Fundamentals and Data Types.

### I love how Python allows you to write codes for small projects and longer projects. You can use it for games, for teaching, and in professional settings. It is very versatile.

### It was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language in 1991.

## Python’s Zen

### In PyCharm or any other python editor, if you type in:

### >>> import this

### And then run it, you would get the following:

### The Zen of Python by Tim Peters

### Beautiful is better than ugly.

### Explicit is better than implicit.

### Simple is better than complex.

### Complex is better than complicated.

### Flat is better than nested.

### Sparse is better than dense.

### Readability counts.

### Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

### Although practicality beats purity.

### Errors should never pass silently.

### Unless explicitly silenced.

### In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

### There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

### Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

### Now is better than never.

### Although never is often better than _right_ now.

### If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

### If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

### Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

### There are actually 20, but it is said: “only 19 have been written down”.

### Enjoy!

## Some of my work using Python:

### 🌎 Latin America Countries:

</iframe>

### This game was created using Pandas and Turtle modules in Python. Users have to guess Latin American Countries using a map. At the end, it saves all unanswered countries in CSV file for user to practice.

# -------

### 🔤 NATO Phonetic Alphabet:

<iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/@layniecast/NATOPhoneticAlphabet?lite=true"></iframe>

### This is a simple program that use Pandas to take input either a name/word and then uses the NATO Phonetic Alphabet to phonetically spell out the name/word.

# -------

### 🧮 Tip Calculator

<iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/@layniecast/TipCalculator?lite=true"></iframe>

### This Tip Calculator takes the number of guests, the bill amount, and tip percentage as input, and then calculates how much each guest will have to pay.

### 🧾💵 Who Pays the Bill?

### After inputting names, it randomly selects who will pay the bill!
