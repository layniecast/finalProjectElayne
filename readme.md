My final website

Overall, the site is mobile and tablet responsive. Site fetches articles from NY Times books section. All links work. I have embedded my python codes via replit using iframe. I have also embedded my Tableau dashboard. The form works and sents submissions to my personal email.
The blog isn't dynamic. I wasn't able to add a Read More link and have it open in a new link. And instead I opened directly in the blog section and worked on it from there. Tabs do work, but doesn't remain active.
